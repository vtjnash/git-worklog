# TODO

What needs doing now. Shipped work is in `git log`; why things are shaped as
they are is in DESIGN.md; what is blocked or undecided is in LATER.md. An item
leaves by being done - or, under *Unverified*, by being run in a real terminal,
when its write-up goes to `cli/test/MANUAL.md` and the line here goes.

## Next

- [ ] Can we design for adding unread entries corresponding to the 'notifications 2 not an issue or pull request, skipped" items (once read/archived they are simply deleted, and refused to be snoozed)
- [ ] a lot of features have been added since last updating the precompile list, so it may need to be regenerated
- [ ] upgrade tmux_jll to latest in Yggdrasil (check for open PR or make our own)

## Upstream

- [ ] **Take Term's header fix once it is released.** FedeClaudi/Term.jl#313
      (merged 2026-09-25, after v2.2.1) keeps a header's inline elements on
      one line; on 2.2.1 `## a `b` c` renders as three centred lines. Bump
      Term, and add the header case to the `render_md` tests.

- [ ] **Take Term's table fitting once it is released.**
      FedeClaudi/Term.jl#314 (open) makes `parse_md(::Markdown.Table)` fit
      the width it is handed, wrapping cells rather than truncating, and
      reads the table's box, style and row rules from the theme
      (`md_table_box`, `md_table_style`, `md_table_compact`). Bump Term; set
      `md_table_box = :MINIMAL_HEAVY_HEAD` and `md_table_compact = true`
      where `load_theme!` sets Term's theme, which is GitHub's look; add a
      test that JuliaLang/julia#63195's second table fits the pane at 60 and
      100 columns with every word of every cell present; and drop the table
      bullet from DESIGN's "Term.jl" section. Check whether a table nested in
      a list still needs `for_term`'s move to code once it is not padded to
      the width.

- [ ] **Drop `parse_gfm` once Julia aligns a plain column left.**
      JuliaLang/julia#63365 (open, RFC) makes `default_align` `:l`. When it
      is in the nightly this runs on, delete `gfm_table`, `GFM_FLAVOR` and
      `parse_gfm` (`ui.jl`), call `Markdown.parse` again, keep the alignment
      test in "a comment is drawn as GitHub draws a comment", and drop the
      bullet from DESIGN's "Julia's Markdown". If it lands as something else
      - a marker for no alignment - map that to `:l` in `for_term` instead.

- [ ] **Code spans before emphasis, once Julia has it.**
      JuliaLang/julia#63364 (open) matches code spans before emphasis, so
      `` *a `abc*` b* `` is italic around a code span. Nothing here works
      around it; when it is in the nightly, add that case to the `render_md`
      tests and drop the bullet from DESIGN's "Julia's Markdown".

- [ ] **File Highlights' `Pkg` import upstream.** `Highlights` 0.6 imports `Pkg`
      at load time for one `Pkg.Registry.reachable_registries()` in
      `available_language_jlls` (`languages.jl:40`), a discovery helper nothing
      calls on the way to highlighting. Measured with Highlights 0.6.2 under
      Term 2.2 on julia nightly, this sandbox: `import Pkg` alone is 0.28-0.30s;
      `import Term` is 0.91s cold and 0.56-0.67s with `Pkg` already loaded, so
      the import is 0.25-0.35s of every launch of everything that highlights
      anything. The fix upstream is `Base.require`-on-demand or an extension on
      `Pkg`. Still on master and still unfiled as of 2026-09-21
      (JuliaDocs/Highlights.jl has no issue on it). File it.

- [ ] **Offer Term a code palette that is part of its theme.** `Term.CodeTheme`
      is a hard-coded `Dict` that `set_theme` never touches; the `Theme` fields
      that look like they do that (`string`, `number`, `operator`, `type`…)
      drive only the old regex highlighter. `term_code_plain!` and the `[code]`
      table in `theme.jl` write into the `Dict` in place, which works only
      because the binding is `const` and the contents are anybody's. Offer a
      patch from the `Term.jl/` clone.

## The list

- [ ] **Discussions, releases, commit comments.** *Decide: whether to open them
      at all.*
      The notifications source sees each arrive and skips it, counted. Nothing
      here can open one.

## Reading

- [ ] **A code span Term wrapped across two lines loses its background.** The
      second line gets a dim backtick and no background.

- [ ] **A search match on a url footnote is marked loosely.** The footnote row
      shows an elided form of the url, so the match is placed against text that
      is not what was searched.

- [ ] **A short fenced block reads as a labelled block.** *Decide: whether a
      short snippet should be part of the sentence instead.*
      A fenced block is a node with its own header and fold state, so a
      three-line snippet gets the same furniture as a file.
